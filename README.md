# Challenge-one

## Descripitoin
This challenge focuses on semantic elements and concise coding. This project began with very few semantic elements. However, by the end I implemented in <header>, <section>, and <article> elements to make the site more accessible. Futhermore, the CSS was clogged by repative code. By consolidating some of that code and adding comments explaining notable parts, we made the code more readable.
